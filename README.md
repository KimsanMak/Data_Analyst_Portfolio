## About Me
Hi, I am Kimsan, an experienced geoscientist and a certified data analyst who has an inquisitive mind and likes to explore new challenges. I have research and analytical experience in groundwater, geological, and mineral resource modeling, and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights. Using my skills set, I have helped companies explore and discovere mineral resources, improve mining operations, and assesse the risk of groundwater contamination. 

I would like to use my experience and data analytic skills to help your company explore the mysterious world of big data, make sense of the numbers, utilize the findings, and discover your precious "gold mine" in it.

This is a repository to share projects that showcase my skills in data analytics.
