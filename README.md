# Kimsan Mak: Data_Analyst_Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, I am Kimsan, an experienced geoscientist and certified data analyst with an inquisitive mind who likes to explore new challenges. I have research and analytical experience in groundwater, geological, and mineral resource modeling, and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights. Using my skill set, I have helped companies explore and discover mineral resources, improve mining operations, and assess the risk of groundwater contamination. 

I want to use my experience and data analytic skills to help your company explore the mysterious world of big data, make sense of the numbers, utilize the findings, and discover your precious "gold mine" in it.

This is a repository to share projects showcasing my data analytics skills.
